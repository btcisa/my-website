                            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                            <p>Hello, my name is Isabel, I like many things in life but among the things I enjoy the
                                most are: music, nature and I have always been attracted to technology since I was very
                                young, contrary to what many would say, I think that Nature and technology are closely
                                related, even because one is born from the study of the other or perhaps there is
                                technology within nature itself, who knows... may be I don't know what I'm saying, but
                                returning to the matter, I think that we can
                                develop technology in a way that does not negatively impact nature. Despite that, I was
                                always a person who interacted a lot with technology but never developed it until now
                                that I became interested in software development and started studying app development.</p>

                            <p>I can say that my experience over nine years in the labor market is reduced to Services,
                                including Tourism, Lodging, Cafeteria, Logistics and Maintenance. From customer service
                                to food preparation. In some areas I have been indirectly related, which has allowed me
                                to learn everything that this entails. I have worked for others and also in my own
                                family business.</p>

                            <p>Having worked for so long in the service area, I developed communication and teamwork
                                skills, being that responsibility,
                                good sense and desire to learn were always my own qualities, finally when I created my
                                own company my ability to identify and solve problems, time management, proactivity,
                                creativity and dedication to complete projects, evolved.</p>
